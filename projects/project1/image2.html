    <p><b>The Korean alphabet</b>, known as Hangul in South Korea or Chosŏn'gŭl in North Korea, has been used to write the Korean language since its creation in the 15th century by King Sejong the Great.</p><br>
    <p><b>The Hangul alphabet</b> originally consisted of 28 letters with 17 consonant letters and 11 vowel letters when it was created. As four became obsolete, the modern Hangul consists of total 24 letters with 14 consonant letters and 10 vowel letters. In North Korea the total is counted 40. It consists of 19 consonant letters and 21 vowel letters as it additionally includes 5 tense consonants (ㄲ ㄸ ㅃ ㅉ ㅆ) and 20 compound and complex vowel letters as well as ㅐ.</p><br>
    <p>The Korean letters are written in <b>syllabic blocks</b> with each alphabetic letter placed vertically and horizontally into a square dimension. For example, the Korean word for "honeybee" (kkulbeol) is written 꿀벌, not ㄲㅜㄹㅂㅓㄹ.[6] As it combines the features of alphabetic and syllabic writing systems, it has been described as an "alphabetic syllabary" by some linguists.</p><br>
