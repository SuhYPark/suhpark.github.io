        <p>Hello! My Name is Suh Park. I am currently a student in QCC Techworks program with the goal of becoming a full stack developer. </p>
        <p>I have always been interested in technology since a young age.  It has gotten me into some trouble when at the age of 12, I took apart machinery to see what was inside.  Eventually I also learned to put it back together.  This curiousity lead to building my first desktop tower instead of buying premade versions from big box stores.  From there, I learned more about computer and how to repair them and now I will learn computer languages as the next step in my journey.</p>
